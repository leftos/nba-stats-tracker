    Creates a calculation network which allows expressions to refer to the result of other expressions, tracks dependencies, and enables natural order recalculation.
  </summary><remarks>
  This class acts as a container for expressions.  As expressions are added to it, their dependencies are tracked and their result is cached.  Expressions defined
  in this class can reference other contained expressions.  Once all expressions are added, a natural order recalculate can be performed.
  </remarks><example>This example shows how to add expressions to the engine and have them reference other contained expressions:
  <code lang="C#">
ExpressionContext context = new ExpressionContext();
VariableCollection variables = context.Variables;

// Add some variables
variables.Add("x", 100);
variables.Add("y", 200);

// Add an expression to the calculation engine as "a"
engine.Add("a", "x * 2", context);

// Add an expression to the engine as "b"
engine.Add("b", "y + 100", context);

// Add an expression at "c" that uses the results of "a" and "b"
// Notice that we have to prefix the expression names with a '$'
engine.Add("c", "$a + $b", context);

// Get the value of "c"
int result = engine.GetResult&lt;int&gt;("c");

// Update a variable on the "a" expression
variables["x"] = 200;

// Recalculate it
engine.Recalculate("a");

// Get the updated result
result = engine.GetResult&lt;int&gt;("c");

        Use this class when you need to customize how an expression is compiled.  For example: by setting

        Use this property to convert the result of an expression to a particular type.  Essentially, it acts as an implicit conversion from the final
        result of the expression to the given type.  When this property is set, the expression will attempt to convert its result to the set value.

        Use this method when you want to inspect the IL that an expression emits.  When set to true, the expression will save its IL to the assembly "Expression.dll"

        Using this property, you can control which members on the expression owner are accessible from an expression.  For example: if users

        <note>
          The default is to only allow access to public members on the expression owner.  Currently, only the Public and NonPublic values of the BindingFlags enumeration

        Use this property to force all integer literals to doubles.  When set to true, an expression like "1/2" will return 0.5 since both integer

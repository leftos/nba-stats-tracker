NBA Stats Tracker
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou


Quick notes

	This tool was made to offer a temporary workaround to the Association/
	Season/My Player/Create A Legend team stats bug. Any game you entered and
	played would have the team stats of the teams that played in it all wrong
	afterwards. For example 85BPG, 92APG, 70RPG, etc. This really ruined the
	immersion the Association offers for those that like to play or even watch
	the games, instead of just simulating them from the Calendar. The Team
	Stats screen was wrong, the in-game overlays about the team were wrong. A
	mess. Even after the first console patches, 2K still hasn't fixed this
	issue.
	
	Don't worry though.
	
	If you have the patience to just enter the Box Score (just the team stats,
	not the players'), in the tool after each game you play, it'll make sure
	that your Team Stats (and the other team's that you played against) will
	be correctly updated.
	
	Just follow these steps:
		1. From in-game, select Play Game, and let it save your career.
		2. Alt-Tab out of the game and into the tool, click on Select, load
			your Career file, and click on Save Team Stats.
		3. Pick a name, any name for the temporary Team Stats file.
			e.g. "Pistons Association, Jan 3rd, vs Lakers"
			It doesn't have to be this descriptive, just something to help you
			remember it.
		4. Alt-Tab into the game and play it or watch it, then after it's done
			let it save your association again.
		5. Alt-Tab into the tool, and click on Load & Update Team Stats. Select
			the Team Stats file that you saved in Step 3.
		6. Enter the Box Score (you may want to note it down on a piece of paper
			to avoid Alt-Tabbing all the time), click OK.
		7. Choose the Career file you're playing in the new dialog.
		8. You're done!

		
Additional Features
-----------------------
Stat Averages, Ranking and Scout Reports
	See how well your team is doing, and scout your next opponent for their 
	strengths and weaknesses in a quick glance!
	
	You can view the averages of each team (such as PPG, RPG, FG%), etc, as well
	as the ranking of each stat in the league, by clicking on "Show Averages",
	after loading your save and selecting a team, of course.
	
	The "eff" averages are efficiency averages, and they take into account
	both the success percentage, as well as the absolute amount. What that means
	is though both a 3-0 and a 6-0 team are on a 1.0 winning %, the second team
	can obviously keep the 1.0 longer, and has more chances of winning the
	division/conference/league. Another example are 3 pointers. Two teams that
	shoot 40% from beyond the arc are dangerous. But if you attempt 5 3-pointers
	in the whole game, 40% means you made two. That's not really dangerous now,
	is it? However, a team that has a 40% success while attempting 15 three
	pointers a game, makes 6 every game! Now that's more like it. Thus, a team
	that has the same percentage with another, but has that on more wins/shots,
	will have a better "eff" average.
	
	The "Win eff" ranking is actually a Power Ranking of sorts, as it shows
	you the relative winning strength of a team in the league, taking account
	not only the winning percentage, but also how many wins they've got so far
	and how close they are to the end of the season.

	You can also view a Scouting Report of any team, in natural language,
	commenting on their pros and cons based on their stat rankings in the
	league, preparing you for a game against them.
	
Team Comparisons and Trends
	Another feature is the Versus window, which compares any two teams' averages
	side-by-side. You can do the following comparisons:
		- Two different teams from the same file
		- A team to its real life counterpart
		- A team to the same team in a different file
		
	The Trends feature allows you to select two different saved team stats
	files and get a report on the developing stats trends between them; which 
	teams are getting better or worse on offense, defense, hustle, etc.
	Before using the Trends feature, load the current stats first, and then
	when you use it you'll be asked to select the older team stats to compare
	to.
	
Export to CSV
	The tool allows you to export the following into CSV files, for use in
	spreadsheet, database or table-editing software (such as Excel), to make
	your life easier if you want to post them to the web.
		- Individual team's stats, averages and rankings
		- League-wide stats and averages
		- Box scores (that you enter manually; can't be extracted from the save)

Custom Leagues
	You can also use all the features this tool offers with any custom league
	up to 30 teams (such as a local league, a league between friends, a college
	league, etc.) Go to File > Create Custom League, enter the names of the
	league's teams, and the tool switches into custom mode. In Custom Mode, all
	Team Stats are directly editable so that you can enter the current league
	stats. Just make sure you click on "Save Team" after you finish changing the
	values manually for each team, and of course "Save To Disk" when you're done
	with the whole league.
	
	Then, after each game, you can use the "Update with new Box Score" feature 
	to have the tool automatically add the box score to the proper stats.
	
	The rest of the features work as well. You can get averages and rankings,
	Scout Reports (they'll only make sense though if the league has 25 to 30 
	teams), and export team and league stats to CSV.
	
	The Custom Leagues feature works for Team Stats files you've saved from
	NBA 2K12 Saves, if you feel the need to experiment with the Team Stats
	directly instead of just updating with Box Scores. You can then inject
	the changes back into your savegame. Be really careful though, as this
	feature, if not used carefully, can screw up your save. Always keep backups,
	and remember that the tool, each time you update an Association file either
	with a Box Score or with an injection, makes a backup of the file before
	the changes that you can find in the same folder, with the same name, and
	the added extension ".bak". This, however, could still be keeping a backup
	of an already screwed up save if you mess around with the edits too much,
	so always keep a manual backup of a save you know that works, in another
	folder.

History
	The tool currently keeps track of the following as you use it for a particular
	save or custom league:
		- Box Scores
	
Real NBA Stats
	This feature allows you to automatically grab the real league's Team Stats 
	and import them into the tool. All that with just a single-click! From there
	on, you can use all the tool's features, including averages, rankings, 
	scouting reports, comparisons, CSV exports, and anything else that finds
	its way into the tool's features, onto the real NBA team stats.
	
	You can also compare any team from your saves or custom leagues (as long as
	it has a real NBA counterpart) to the real NBA team in a head-to-head
	comparison!
	
		
Known Issues
	I can't tell you if the tool will work for you or not. It may work for one 
	Association you have, but not for another. See the discussion thread (link
	at the bottom of this readme file) for the reason.

	It's working fine with Custom Leagues.
	

Disclaimer
	The tool is still in beta. I've tested it in my environment, on my
	Association files and it seems to work perfectly. If you encounter any
	problems, you'll find a backup of your Association in the Saves folder.
	Keep one thing in mind however...
	
					ALWAYS KEEP BACKUPS OF YOUR SAVES!
					
	I won't take any responsibility if this tool messes up your Saves. You've
	been warned.

Version History
	Nightly - Apr 25
		- Change: The program now uses SQLite 3 databases instead of the custom 
		   binary format; this means that previously saved Team Stats file are
		   incompatible with this version
		- Change: Massive UI overhaul, more details below
		- Change: Tool now gives you access to both regular season and playoff
		   stats at the same time
		- Added: Team Overview screen; all statistics can be limited to a 
		   specific timeframe if the required box scores are available
			* Overview: View your team's stats; limit them to a timeframe and 
			   see your opponents' stats against you during that time
			* Split Stats: See how a team's performing when winning or losing, 
			   at home or away, during the regular season or the playoffs, as 
			   well as its monthly progress
			* Box Scores: View any team's box scores in an easy to search table
			* Head-To-Head: Compare your team to any other team; compare stats 
			   against the league, as well as each other
		- Added: League Overview screen; again, all statistics can be limited 
		   to a timeframe if you have the box scores
			* Team Stats: Similar to the 2K Team Stats table, a full overview 
			   of the league team averages in a sortable table
			* Playoff Stats: Same as above, but limits the stats to those that
			   apply to the Playoffs
			* Box Scores: Easy access to all box scores saved in the loaded 
			   database
		- Added: Box Scores can now be edited
		- Added: Box Scores now require a Season number as well as the date the 
		   game took place; you can also differentiate between regular season 
		   and playoff games for the split stats
		- Added: Box Scores can now be added to an NST Database without being
		   added to the Team Stats; that way you can add your team's past box
		   scores without affecting its Team Stats
		- Added: The tool now works irrelevant of the amount of teams in the
		   league; it should work without error for leagues with 2 teams or 50
		   teams; the 30 team limit is no more; the Scouting Reports still work
		   optimally for 30 teams, they do not adjust to leagues with less or
		   more teams (yet!)
		- Added: Support for multiple seasons; the tool now retains stats and
		   box scores between seasons, so that you can compare performances
		   and stats with those of previous years, with clear distinction of
		   the stats of each season
		   
	v0.8 - Mar 21
		- Added keeping history of Box Score updates
		- Changed Team Stats file structure to allow for further expansion and
		   changes; this means that Saved Team Stats from versions previous to
		   this one aren't compatible
		- Other minor fixes and improvements
		
	v0.7.3 - Jan 23
		- Added preview of Trends feature
		- Uncluttered interface; many buttons moved to menus, keyboard shortcuts
		   added

		- Tool can now create and edit custom leagues, offering features such
		   as updating with Box Scores, team averages and rankings and CSV
		   exporting to other leagues too, besides NBA 2K12 Saves (more info
		   above); when the tool's in custom league mode, all stats are directly
		   editable
		- Tool can now inject the directly editable custom league stats into
		   an NBA 2K12 save; so there is a way to directly edit the stats of
		   your save if you so choose, it's explained above
		- Tool can now export manually inputted Box Scores to CSV
		- Versus window implemented, comparing any two teams' averages
		   
	v0.5 - Jan 9

		- Tool now checks for saved team stats and Association file compatibility
		   when the user uses "Load & Update Team Stats"; if updating the team

		   the tool shows a warning

	v0.4 - Jan 9
		- Scouting Reports implemented, translating the stat rankings of each
		   team into natural comments about their play, combining different

	In version 1.12.0.7, downloading the real NBA stats automatically has been re-enabled after permission was granted from Basketball-Reference.com. Kudos to Rosque from the NLSC Forum for getting in touch with them and getting permission.

	Version 1.12.0.10 has subtle UI changes that reflect the fact that NBA Stats Tracker is able to import and export from NBA 2K13 savegames using the newly-released REDitor Modding Center.
